        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p><strong>org-id.guide is the easiest, quickest and most accurate way to locate organization identifiers.</strong></p>
        <p>We maintain a register of organization lists. Those lists, in turn, provide unique identifiers for companies, charities, government agencies and other kinds of organizations.</p>
        <p>We provide a code for each list, so that with the code, plus the identifier, you should be able to uniquely and unambiguously identify any organization in the world.</p>
        <p>Many of the lists in our register are official identifier sources (such as a country company register); other lists may be maintained by third-parties. When we can, we link out to websites where you can look up a specific organization, although we also include codes for lists that don't provide a public search service.</p>
        <p>We welcome new additions or updates to the register. We don't pre-judge the kinds of lists that should be included - but we do make sure the register includes good meta-data. We use that meta-data to provide a quality score that indicates how accessible and stable identifiers from the list are likely to be.</p>
      </div>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>org-id.guide has been created by a partnership of open data standards groups in order to provide a robust, shared approach to the use of <strong>open</strong>, <strong>interoperable</strong> and <strong>unambiguous</strong> organization identifers.</p>
        <p>It is a collaborative project designed to fill a gap in our shared data infrastructure.</p>
        <p>With org-id.guide you can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Declare which list an identifier is taken from - increasing data interoperability;</p></li>
          <li><p>Identify the best lists to use for new datasets - promoting openness;</p></li>
          <li><p>Find out where to look up more information on an organization - improving analysis and data quality; </p></li>
          <li><p>Discover crosswalks between different lists - supporting joined-up data;</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The members of the org-id.guide initiative use the register as a codelist to validate data, and to populate data entry user interfaces so that good quality data is created at source. </p>

      <h2 id="data-creators">Data creators</h2>
      <p>Are you collecting or publishing data about organizations? </p>
      <p><strong>First</strong>, make sure you are collecting an identifier for each organization, as well as a name. You can lookup the best identifier list to use based on the country, organization type, or sector you are managing data for.</p>
      <p><strong>Second</strong>, when you store and publish data about an organization, you can use the list code for the organization identifier so that data users know which list the identifier is from.</p>
      <p>You can do this by combining the list code and identifier in a single string:</p>
      <p>E.g.<p>
        <code class="about-page__code">GB-COH-09506232</code>
        <p>Or separating out the list code into it’s own field:</p>
        <p>E.g.</p>
        <pre><code class="about-page__code">{
    "scheme": "GB-COH",
    "id": "09506232
}</code></pre>

        <p>If you’ve come across an organization identifier, you can use org-id.guide to find out more about it and where to locate related open data.</p>

        <h2>Data contributors</h2>

        <p>We welcome new submissions to org-id.guide. The <a href="http://docs.org-id.guide">contributors handbook</a> details how you can submit a request or proposal for a new list to be included. New submissions are reviewed by the org-id.guide members.</p>
        <p>You can:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><p>Request research to identify an appropriate list</p></li>
          <li><p>Propose a new list</p></li>
          <li><p>Propose changes to an existing list in the register</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Following a light research process, new entries can be included in the codelist within 7 days. Entries are never removed from the downloadable list, but may be deprecated.</p>
