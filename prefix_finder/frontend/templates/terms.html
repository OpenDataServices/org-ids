      <h3>Understanding website visitor and traffic patterns</h3>
      We collect data about your visits to the website, for the purpose of analysing how the website is used, so that we can improve it. A self hosted copy of Matomo is used for this.

        <li>Referrer (what page you arrived at one of our web pages from)</li>
        <li>Information about your device, OS and browser</li>
      </ul>We do not use this data to personally identify individuals, but it is possible that it could be used to do so, particularly if combined with other datasets.</p>

      <p>You can opt out of this processing:
      If you have set your web browser to "I do not want to be tracked" (DoNotTrack is enabled) then Matomo will not track your visit.</p>

      <p>Matomo also it’s own opt out mechanism:</p>
      <!-- opt out iframe - clicking this will mean people can opt out of tracking -->
